        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 8, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the privacy practices for the <strong>Infinite Adventure</strong> mobile application (the "App"), available on the Google Play Store.</p>

        <p>This policy is to inform you that <strong>Infinite Adventure</strong> is designed with user privacy as a top priority.</p>

        <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>

        <p><strong>Infinite Adventure</strong> <strong>does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data.</strong> We do not gather any information that can be used to identify you or your device. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other contact information.</li>
            <li>Usernames, passwords, or other account credentials.</li>
            <li>Device identifiers (e.g., IMEI, MAC address, advertising ID).</li>
            <li>Usage data, analytics, or app interaction information that is sent off the device.</li>
            <li>Any other information that could be considered personal or sensitive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since we do not collect any user data, there is no data to use, share, or sell to third parties.</p>

        <h2>2. Location Data</h2>

        <p><strong>Infinite Adventure</strong> <strong>does not collect, use, or share your precise or approximate location.</strong> The App does not require access to your device's location services to function.</p>

        <h2>3. Special Permissions</h2>

        <p><strong>Infinite Adventure</strong> <strong>requires no special permissions</strong> to run on your device. The App is designed to operate without needing access to sensitive device features or data, such as your contacts, camera, microphone, storage, or other areas that often require explicit user consent. The standard permissions automatically granted by the Android operating system for any app to run are utilized, but no additional, potentially privacy-intrusive permissions are requested or used.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Safety Section on Google Play Store</h2>

        <p>The information provided in the Data Safety section of our Google Play Store listing accurately reflects these practices, indicating that no user data is collected or shared by the App.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p><strong>Infinite Adventure</strong> does not integrate with any third-party services that would collect data from users on our behalf.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>Since <strong>Infinite Adventure</strong> does not collect any user data, it does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe a child has inadvertently provided any information, please contact us, though we reiterate that our App is not designed to collect such information.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>

        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:[Your Email Address]">[Your Email Address or a Link to Your Contact Webpage]</a></p>

        <p>By using <strong>Infinite Adventure</strong>, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our App.</p>
